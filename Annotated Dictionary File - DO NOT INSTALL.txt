THIS IS JUST A REFERENCE FILE, DO NOT INSTALL THIS INTO PLOVER AS A DICTIONARY!! IT WILL NOT WORK!
THIS IS MY NOTES/ANNOTATIONS ON ALL THE CHANGES I MADE TO EXISTING BRIEFS IN THE DEFAULT PLOVER DICTIONARY, THE NEW BRIEFS I CREATED, AND MORE.

"AEUPBT": "ain't", /already in library

"R-PBT": "are not", /swapped

"T-LD": "it would", /already in dictionary
"T*D": "it’d", /already in dictionary
it had /am considering -TD for it had (it's 'the' right now), OR changing T-D from {^ed it} to 'it had' and changing -TD from 'the' to '{^ed it} (or use *TD for ed it)

"HRETS": "let us", /changed from let's
"HR*ETS": "let’s", /changed from lets (lets is a term primarily used in UK/non-USA English, equivalent to 'rent' in meaning. I just use HRET/S for lets, since I use it rarely.  Others may wish to leave this as is.)

"PHAO*EUF": "might’ve", /added
Might not
Mightn’t

"PHUPBT": "must not", /swapped from mustn't

"SHAOEL": "she will", /swapped from she'll
"SHAO*EL": "she’ll," /already in dictionary
"SHELD": "she would," /already in dictionary, but not consistent with SHAOE :(
she had
"SHAO*ED": "she’d", /already in dictionary

(tons of 'somebody' options, I prefer SPH-B as the root)
"SPH-BL": "somebody will", /added
"SPH*BL": "somebody'll", /added
"SPH-BLD": "somebody would", /added
"SPH-BD": "somebody had", /added - note orthographically this would be "somebodied"
"SPH*BD": "somebody'd", /added
"SPH-BS": "somebody is", /changed from "somebodies" (which you can get via SPH-B/-S or SPH-B/Z, is rare enough used word it doesn't need a dedicated single stroke imho)
"SPH-BZ": "somebody has", /added - note orthographically this would be 'somebodies' but SPH-B/-S or SPH-B/Z will work for 'somebodies'
"SPH*BS": "somebody's", /added

(numerous 'someone' options, I prefer SPH-PB as the root. All of these are new entries, some bump against orthography but the orthographic strokes are nonsensicle - such as  'someoneds')
"SPH-PBL": "someone will", /added
"SPH*PBL": "someone'll", /added
"SPH-PBLD": "someone would", /added
"SPH-PBD": "someone had", /added

"SPH-PBS": "someone is", /added
"SPH-PBZ": "someone has", /added
"SPH*PBS": "someone's", /added

(again, numerous 'something' options, I prefer SPH as the root. These are all new entries, a bit of orthographic bumping but if you really need to write  somethingeds you can double-stroke it ;D)
SPH-LG": "something will
SPH*LG": "something'll
SPH-LGD": "something would
SPH-GD": "something had
SPH-GS": "something is
SPH-GZ": "something has
SPH*GS": "something's

"THA*L": "that’ll", /already in dictionary
"THALD": "that would", /already in dictionary
"THA*D": "that’d", /already in dictionary

"THAOERS", "these are", /already in dictionary
"THAO*ERS", "these're", /added

"TH-L": "this will", /changed from this'll
"TH*L": "this’ll", /already in dictionary
"TH-S": "this is", /already in dictionary
this's
this'd


(several options for 'those,' I prefer THOEZ, but sometimes also use THOES because of simpler/easier fingering, so both are used as a root for most of these entries, except where creates conflicts)
"THOELS": "those will", /added
"THOELZ": "those will", /added
"THO*ELS": "those'll", /added
"THO*ELZ": "those'll", /added
"THOELDZ": "those would", /added
"THOED": "those had", /added, note dropped the S due to SD fingering impossibility so doesn't follow pattern
"THOEDZ": "those had", /added
"THO*ED": "those'd", /added, note dropped the S due to SD fingering impossibility so doesn't follow pattern
"THO*EDZ": "those'd", /added for Z consistency
"THOEFS": "those of", /already in dictionary as an 'of' brief, so I made the Z variant the 'have' phrase ender for the 'those' family, so this breaks pattern somewhat)
"THOEFZ": "those have",
"THOEFZ": "those of", /added
"THO*EFS": "those've", /added
"THO*ERZ": "those are", /added
"THO*ERZ": "those're", /added

"WAOEF": "we have", /changed from we've
"W*EF": "we’ve", /already in dictionary
"WAO*EF": "we've", /changed from 'weave' - WAEF meets using spelling for homophones rule (and there's that WEF oddity for weave, which could be changed to "we have" if prefer WE root)
